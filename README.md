Employee Management System
Objective:
Develop a command-line Employee Management System using Python that allows a company to manage information about their employees and departments using OOP and data structures.
Requirements:
•	Employee Class:
o	Create an Employee class with attributes for name, ID, title, and department.
o	Include a method to display employee details.
o	Implement a string representation method that returns the employee's name and ID.
•	Department Class:
o	Create a Department class with attributes for department name and a list of employees.
o	Include methods to add an employee, remove an employee, and list all employees in the department.
•	Data Structure for Company:
o	Use a dictionary to represent the company, with department names as keys and Department objects as values.
o	Implement functions to add a department, remove a department, and display all departments.
•	User Interaction:
o	Write a function that prints a menu for the user to interact with the Employee Management System (e.g., Add Employee, Remove Employee, Display Department, etc.).
o	The user should be able to add employees to departments, remove employees, and view department details.
•	Data Persistence (Optional – understanding the knowledge of streams):
o	Save the company data to a file and load it back into the system on startup. (This can be plain text, JSON, or any other format you deem appropriate.)
Instructions:
•	Structure your code with appropriate classes and functions.
•	Ensure your classes use proper encapsulation for attributes.
•	Include error handling for cases such as adding an employee to a non-existent department.
•	Write clear instructions for the user on how to use the command-line interface.
•	Comment your code to explain your logic and design decisions.
•	(Optional) Include unit tests to validate your methods.
Deliverables:
•	Python script(s) (.py files) that run the Employee Management System.
•	(Optional) A text or JSON file containing the company data.
•	(Optional) A test script with unit tests.
Evaluation Criteria:
•	Correct implementation of OOP principles.
•	Efficient use of data structures.
•	Code readability and comments.
•	Error handling and edge case consideration.
•	Unit tests (Optional) and testing strategy.
